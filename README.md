# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to focus on math and reading scores for a distract that was about to have a board meeting. However, we later found out that some of the scores for the ninth grade class at Thomas High School may have been altered. It was decided that the best way to see a fair representation of the data, we needed to remove the data of the ninth grade class. We then  analyzed the data again, without the ninth grade classes data from Thomas High School.

# Results:

The school summary is affected in the areas of:
- The total amount of students
- Average Math Score
- % Passing Math
- % Passing Reading
- % Overall Passing
## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
### Math and reading scores by grade
#### Original Analysis of Reading Scores:

#### Analysis After of Reading Scores:

- Replacing the ninth-grade  reading scores affects the reading scores only for Thomas High School in the adjusted analysis.
#### Original Analysis Math Scores:

#### Analysis After of Math Scores:

- Replacing the ninth-grade math scores affects the math scores only for Thomas High Shool in the adjusted analysis.
### Scores by school spending
#### Original Analysis of Spending Summary:
![This is an image](https://github.com/ricky7133/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Spending%20Summary%20(before).png)
#### Analysis After of Spending Summary:
![This is an image](https://github.com/ricky7133/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Spending%20Range%20(after).png)
- The analysis of this data shows us that the spending summary does not change between the original data and the adjusted data.
# Summary: 
As we can see, the adjusted analysis changes very little when we took out the grades for the ninth-graders at Thomas High School.
