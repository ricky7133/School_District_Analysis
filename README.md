# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to focus on math and reading scores for a distract that was about to have a board meeting. However, we later found out that some of the scores for the ninth grade class at Thomas High School may have been altered. It was decided that the best way to see a fair representation of the data, we needed to remove the data of the ninth grade class. We then  analyzed the data again, without the ninth grade classes data from Thomas High School.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

#How is the school summary affected?
